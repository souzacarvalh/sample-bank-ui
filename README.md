# Sample Bank

This application simulates a simple internet banking platform, offering common bank operations in both formats -
UI and API.

It was created for training purposes, especially test automation trainings which require some application
to be tested, whereas it should not be using a complex business requirement for that.

This version (v3) is based on modern development approaches such as microservices and responsive UI, hence called Microservices Edition.
